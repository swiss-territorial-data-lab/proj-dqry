## Overview

This project provides a suite of scripts and configuration files to perform quarries automatic detections in georeferenced raster images with Deep Learning method. For object detection, tools developed in `object-detector` git repository are used.

The procedure is defined in three distinct workflows:
1. **Training and Evaluation** workflow allowing to train and evaluate the detection model with a customed dataset reviewed by domain experts and constituing the ground truth. The detector is initially trained on _SWISSIMAGE 10 cm_ mosaic of 2020 ([swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/fr/geodata/images/ortho/swissimage10.html)) from using the _TLM_ data of _swisstopo_ as Ground Truth.
2. **Prediction** workflow performing inference detection of quarries in a given image dataset (year) thanks to the previously trained model.
3. **Detection monitoring** workflow tracking quarry evolution over years.

A global documentation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/stdl-tech-website/tree/master/docs/PROJ-DQRY). 

## Hardware and OS requirements

The workflows have been run with Ubuntu 20.04 OS on a GPU machine with 32 Gbits RAM. The main limitation is the number of tiles to proceed and the amount of prediction. The provided requirements stand for a zoom level equal to or below 17 and for an AOI corresponding to SWISSIMAGE acquisition footprints (about a third of Switzerland surface max). For higher zoom level and/or a larger AOI, the number of data to process might lead to memory saturation. In this case either a more powerful machine will be required, or the AOI will need to be subdivided in a smaller area.

## Python libraries

The scripts have been developed with Python 3.8 by importing libraries that are listed in `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`. Before starting to run scripts make sure the required Python libraries that have been used during the code development are installed, otherwise incompatibilities and errors could occur. A clean method to install Python libraries is to work with a virtual environment preserving the package dependencies.

## Scripts and configuration files

The `proj-dqry` repository (https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/proj-dqry) contains **scripts** to prepare and post-process the datasets:

1. `prepare_data.py` 
2. `prediction_filter.py` 
3. `detection_monitoring.py` 
4. `plots.py` 
5. `batch_process.sh` 

The description of each script can be found [here](/scripts/README.md).  

In addition, the object detection itself is performed by tools developed in `object-detector` git repository. The description of the scripts used are presented here: https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/object-detector

Configurations files used to set the input parameters of the scripts and model are located in the **config** folder:

1. `config-trne.yaml` 
2. `config-prd.yaml` 
3. `config-prd.template.yaml` 
4. `config-dm.yaml` 
5. `detectron2_config_dqry.yaml` 

 The detailed instructions to run the workflows can be found [here](/config/README.md).
